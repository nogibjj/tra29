This will be a python repository template for automating Python project initialization
This template has a template tests directory and src directory for any project documents. It also provides the automated architecture for 
the project via a requirements file, makefile, Dockerfile, and githup workflow which (in its current state) will install dependencies, lint the source code, perform a unittest as a template action, and format the code.
